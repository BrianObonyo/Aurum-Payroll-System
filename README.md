#### Project Description for Resume:
```
Aurum Payroll Platform | Full Stack Developer
• Built enterprise-grade payroll management system with JWT authentication 
  and role-based access control
• Implemented RESTful API with Express.js serving 10+ endpoints with full 
  CRUD operations
• Designed responsive UI with dark/light mode supporting mobile, tablet, 
  and desktop devices
• Integrated SQLite database with normalized schema for employees, 
  departments, and payslips
• Deployed scalable application handling concurrent users with secure 
  authentication
```

### 4. **Interview Talking Points**

#### When discussing this project, mention:

**Technical Decisions:**
- "I chose JWT over sessions for better scalability and stateless authentication"
- "I implemented bcrypt for password hashing to ensure security best practices"
- "I used SQLite for rapid development, but the schema is designed to easily migrate to PostgreSQL"
- "I built a responsive CSS system without frameworks to demonstrate core CSS skills"

**Problem Solving:**
- "I implemented middleware to protect routes and handle authentication errors"
- "I added loading states and error handling for better UX"
- "I optimized the database queries to reduce N+1 problems"

**Future Improvements:**
- "I'd add role-based permissions (admin, manager, employee)"
- "I'd implement payslip PDF generation"
- "I'd add email notifications for payslip releases"
- "I'd migrate to PostgreSQL and add Redis for session caching"
- "I'd add unit tests with Jest and integration tests"

### 5. **Code Quality Points**

Show you write professional code by:
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Comments on complex logic
- ✅ Modular, reusable code
- ✅ Secure coding practices
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ SQL injection prevention

### 6. **Demonstrate Growth Mindset**

Add a "Learnings" section to your README:
```markdown
## 🧠 What I Learned
- Implementing secure authentication from scratch
- Building RESTful APIs following REST principles
- Database schema design and normalization
- Responsive design without frameworks
- State management in vanilla JavaScript
- API error handling and user feedback
```
